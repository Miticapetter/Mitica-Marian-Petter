    <h1>Early life and education</h1>

    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>Mihajlo Pupin was born on 9 October (27 September, OS) 1858 in the village of Idvor (in the modern-day municipality of <br> Kovačica, Serbia) in Banat, in the Military Frontier in the Austrian Empire. He always remembered the words of his <br> mother and cited her in his autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor (1925):</p>

    <p>
        
“My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which you hear so much at the neighborhood gatherings, you must<br>
provide yourself with another pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing. There is so much wonderful knowledge and<br> 
learning in the world which you cannot get unless you can read and write. Knowledge is the golden ladder over which we<br> 
climb to heaven; knowledge is the light which illuminates our path through this life and leads to a future life of<br> 
everlasting glory.”<br>
Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox school, and later to German elementary school<br> 
in Perlez. He enrolled in high school in Pančevo, and later in the Real Gymnasium. He was one of the best students<br> 
there; a local archpriest saw his enormous potential and talent, and influenced the authorities to give Pupin a scholarship.<br>
Because of his activity in the “Serbian Youth” movement, which at that time had many problems with Austro-Hungarian<br>
police authorities, Pupin had to leave Pančevo. In 1872, he went to Prague, where he continued the sixth and first half<br>
of the seventh year. After his father died in March 1874, the sixteen-year-old Pupin decided to cancel his education<br> 
in Prague due to financial problems and to move to the United States.<br>
“When I landed at Castle Garden, forty-eight years ago, I had only five cents in my pocket. Had I brought five<br> 
hundred dollars, instead of five cents, my immediate career in the new, and to me perfectly strange, land would<br> 
have been the same. A young immigrant such as I was then does not begin his career until he has spent all the money<br> 
which he has brought with him. I brought five cents, and immediately spent it upon a piece of prune pie, which turned<br> 
out to be a bogus prune pie. It contained nothing but pits of prunes. If I had brought five hundred dollars, it would have<br> 
taken me a little longer to spend it, mostly upon bogus things, but the struggle which awaited me would have been the same in<br> 
each case. It is no handicap to a boy immigrant to land here penniless; it is not a handicap to any boy to be penniless when he<br> 
strikes out for an independent career, provided that he has the stamina to stand the hardships that may be in store for him.”<br>
Studies in America and Ph.D For the next five years in the United States, Pupin worked as a manual laborer (most notably at<br> 
the biscuit factory on Cortlandt Street in Manhattan) while he learned English, Greek and Latin. He also gave private lectures.<br> 
After three years of various courses, in the autumn of 1879 he successfully finished his tests and entered Columbia College,<br> 
where he became known as an exceptional athlete and scholar. A friend of Pupin's predicted that his physique would make him a<br> 
splendid oarsman, and that Columbia would do anything for a good oarsman. A popular student, he was elected president of his<br> 
class in his Junior year. He graduated with honors in 1883 and became an American citizen at the same time.<br>
He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1889 he returned to Columbia University<br> 
to become a lecturer of mathematical physics in the newly formed Department of Electrical Engineering. Pupin's research pioneered<br> 
carrier wave detection and current analysis.<br>
Pupin completed his studies in 1883 as one of the best students, especially in the field of physics and mathematics, which gave him<br> 
a diploma. Later, he went back to Europe, initially the United Kingdom (1883–1885), where he continued his schooling at the<br> 
University of Cambridge. He was an early investigator into X-ray imaging, but his claim to have made the first X-ray image in the<br> 
United States is incorrect. He learned of Röntgen's discovery of unknown rays passing through wood, paper, insulators, and thin<br> 
metals leaving traces on a photographic plate, and attempted this himself. Using a vacuum tube, which he had previously used to<br> 
study the passage of electricity through rarefied gases, he made successful images on January 2, 1896. Edison provided Pupin with<br> 
a calcium tungstate fluoroscopic screen which, when placed in front of the film, shortened the exposure time by twenty times,<br> 
from one hour to a few minutes. Based on the results of experiments, Pupin concluded that the impact of primary X-rays generated<br>
secondary X-rays. With his work in the field of X-rays, Pupin gave a lecture at the New York Academy of Sciences. He was the first<br> 
person to use a fluorescent screen to enhance X-rays for medical purposes. A New York surgeon, Dr. Bull, sent Pupin a patient to obtain<br> 
an X-ray image of his left hand prior to an operation to remove lead shot from a shotgun injury. The first attempt at imaging failed because<br> 
the patient, a well-known lawyer, was "too weak and nervous to be stood still nearly an hour" which is the time it took to get an X-ray photo<br> 
at the time. In another attempt, the Edison fluorescent screen was placed on a photographic plate and the patient's hand on the screen. X-rays<br> 
passed through the patients hand and caused the screen to fluoresce, which then exposed the photographic plate. A fairly <br> good image was obtained 
with an exposure of only a few seconds and showed the shot as if "drawn with pen and ink." Dr. Bull was able to take out<br> 
all of the lead balls in a very short time.</p>
